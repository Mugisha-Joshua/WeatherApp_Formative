# Elegant Weather App  

An interactive and visually appealing weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data using the Open Meteo API. The app allows users to search for a city and view its current weather, wind speed, and a 7-day forecast.

## Features  
- Real-time weather updates using [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).  
- Dynamic icons for weather conditions based on weather codes.  
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.  
- 7-day forecast with temperature highs and lows.  
- Error handling for invalid locations and API issues.

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/elegant-weather-app.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project folder:

## API Details  

### APIs Used  
1. **Geocoding API** ([Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)):  
   - Endpoint: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`  
   - Parameters:  
     - `name`: City name  
     - `count`: Number of results to fetch  
     - `language`: Language for results (default: English)  

2. **Weather Forecast API** ([Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)):  
   - Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`  
   - Parameters:  
     - `latitude` and `longitude`: Coordinates of the city  
     - `current_weather`: Boolean for fetching current weather  
     - `daily`: Fields to include in daily forecasts

## Deployment Process  

### Hosting on Web Servers  
1. Prepare the application files (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`) by ensuring they are complete and error-free.  
2. Upload the files to your web servers (e.g., via SFTP or a deployment pipeline).  

### Configuring the Load Balancer  
1. Deploy the application on two web servers (e.g., `server1` and `server2`).  
2. Set up a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer or NGINX) to distribute traffic between the two servers.  
3. Configuration steps:  
   - Register the two web servers (`server1` and `server2`) as target instances.  
   - Use health checks to ensure the servers are operational.  
   - Set the algorithm to Round Robin (or another appropriate method).  

### Testing the Load Balancer  
1. Verify the application is accessible via the load balancerâ€™s public IP or domain.  
2. Simulate multiple users accessing the application and confirm traffic is balanced.  
3. Test failover by shutting down one server and verifying that the other handles the requests seamlessly.

## Challenges and Solutions  

1. **Challenge**: Integrating multiple APIs and handling inconsistent data.  
   - **Solution**: Implemented error handling in JavaScript to display user-friendly messages for API errors.  

2. **Challenge**: Load balancer not routing traffic properly.  
   - **Solution**: Corrected the server health checks and ensured both servers had identical configurations.  

3. **Challenge**: Displaying weather icons dynamically.  
   - **Solution**: Created a `weatherIcons` object to map weather codes to emojis.
