## API Details  

### APIs Used  
1. **Geocoding API** ([Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)):  
   - Endpoint: `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search`  
   - Parameters:  
     - `name`: City name  
     - `count`: Number of results to fetch  
     - `language`: Language for results (default: English)  

2. **Weather Forecast API** ([Documentation](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)):  
   - Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`  
   - Parameters:  
     - `latitude` and `longitude`: Coordinates of the city  
     - `current_weather`: Boolean for fetching current weather  
     - `daily`: Fields to include in daily forecasts

## Deployment Process  

### Hosting on Web Servers  
1. Prepared the application files (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`) by ensuring they are complete and error-free.  
2. Uploaded the files to my WEB-01 and WEB-02 (i.e, via SFTP).
3. Configured nginx to serve the application. 

### Configuring the Load Balancer  
1. Deployed the application on the two web servers (e.g., `WEB-01` and `WEB-02`).  
2. Set up the load balancer using `HAPROXY`  to distribute traffic between the two servers.  
3. Configuration steps:  
   - Registered the two web servers (`WEB-01` and `WEB-02`) as target instances.
     
### Testing the Load Balancer  
1. Verified the application is accessible via the load balancerâ€™s public IP and domain.  
2. Simulated multiple users accessing the application and confirm traffic is balanced.  
3. Test failover by shutting down one server and verifying that the other handles the requests seamlessly.

## Challenges and Solutions  

1. **Challenge**: Integrating multiple APIs and handling inconsistent data.  
   - **Solution**: Implemented error handling in JavaScript to display user-friendly messages for API errors.  

2. **Challenge**: Load balancer not routing traffic properly.  
   - **Solution**: Corrected the server health checks and ensured both servers had identical configurations.  

3. **Challenge**: Displaying weather icons dynamically.  
   - **Solution**: Created a `weatherIcons` object to map weather codes to emojis.
4. **Challenge**: The Humidity display option isn't working and I haven't benn able to identify the bug and correct it.
